To install ALLFRAME from the git repository, you need a daophot4.tar file
that you have to retrieve from Peter Stetson.

Then, to create the final tarball do:

      tar xf file/to/daophot4.tar -C src
      autoreconf -i
      ./configure
      make distcheck

See the INSTALL file for more on how to install the finalized full
allframe-4.x.x.tar.gz produced tar ball.
