To install ALLFRAME from the git repository, you need a daophot4.tar file
that you have to retrieve from Peter Stetson.

Then, do:

      tar xf file/to/daophot4.tar -C src
      autoreconf -i

It will create configure and all the necessary Makefile.in
Finally, create what you want and check the regular INSTALL file.
