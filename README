ALLFRAME
========

This is a re-packaging of the crowded stellar photometry software DAOPHOT
and its subsequent ALLSTAR, DAOGROW, DAOMATCH, DAOMASTER and ALLFRAME.

The idea is only to ease distribution and compiling, so the original
source code is left unmodified. Oonly one extra executable was added:
daopsf, to create a FITS image of a Point Spread Function oversampled
by a factor of 2.

See the INSTALL file for installation. Although the packaging code is
open source, the original DAOPHOT/ALLFRAME FORTRAN code is
unfortunately not.

If you are reading this README file from the github web site, you
will need to get the allframe source code. You will need to contact
the main DAOPHOT author to sign the DAOPHOT agreement and email the
author of this github repository to get a copy of the signed agreement
to get the fully packaged tar ball.

If you are not familiar with these programs, you are also strongly
advised to read the following papers:
