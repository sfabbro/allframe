ALLFRAME
========

This is a re-packaging of the crowded stellar photometry software DAOPHOT
and its subsequent ALLSTAR, DAOGROW, DAOMATCH, DAOMASTER and ALLFRAME.

The idea is only to ease distribution and compiling, so the original
code is left unmodified. So far only one extra executable was added:
daopsf, to create a FITS image of a Point Spread Function oversampled
by a factor of 2.

See the INSTALL file for installation.

If you are not familiar with these programs, you are also strongly
advised to read the following papers:
